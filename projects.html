            <h2>Baseball Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>Inspired by FastAi's Deep Learning for Coders course, a unique pitching database was created. The data aids a video trimming model 
                that identifies pitcher's handedness, selects suitable video footage, and uses mediapipe to calculate max
                knee height.</p>

            <h2>Bat Data</h2>
            <p>This project, initially an interview exercise assigned by Ben Hansen from Intel's Olympic technology group, 
                was part of an application process for a Biomechanics Intern role. Despite initial struggles, the project 
                was later revisited as a means to practice Python coding and review forgotten mathematical concepts.</p>

            <h2>Bat Speed Analysis</h2>
            <p>This project was completely inspired by Steve Schuster, Author of Growcasting. His twitter handle is 
                @growcasting, and his twitter thread focused on using the POI metrics from Driveline Baseball on pitching
                and attempting to predict pitch velocity. Similarily, this analysis looked at POI metrics on hitting and 
                attempted to predict bat speed.</p>

            <h2>Tilt Clock</h2>
            <p>This was one of the first projects that I completed in Python. Although extremely rough, at the request of 
                a coach, he wanted to look at a specific pitcher and whether or not they changed their spin axis from the 
                previous season. Was a good first step into some more applied python projects.</p>

                include pitching reports, hitting reports, coaching tendencies, and fielding reports. </p>
